## Pandemic
Since the entire world living a pandemic. We need to evaluate 
population health to take actions so.

As a Cbba goberment 

We want a system to manage this kind of information

So that we can review the information and see what kind of 
actions take with the population.

# Practice - First requirement
We need to see a report with the following information:

+ Sick people
+ ~~People that died for the sikness~~
+ People that recover from the sikness

# Practice - Second requirement
Since we have a report from all population we whant to classify
that information with the following criteria:

+ Women that are sick
+ Men that are sick
+ ~~Women that died for the sikness~~
+ ~~Men that died for the sikness~~
+ Women that recover from the sikness
+ Men that recover from the sikness

# Practice - Third requirement
Now we need some more specific information, we need to know:

+ Adult's that are sick
+ Young's that are sick
+ Kid's that are sick
+ Adult's that recover from the sikness 
+ Young's that recover from the sikness
+ Kid's that recover from the sikness

# Practice - Fourth requirement
From where we should take all this infomation to generate this reports?

I think, we should contact to the hospitals. And ask them for persons that 
have the sikness.
